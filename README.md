# List Pagination & Filtering Project

* In this project I improved the usability of a web page that contained a long list of student records.
* The app generates a dynamic amount of pages. For Example, if the HTML file contains 54 student records, the app will generate 6 pages. On each of the pages 1 to 5 there will be 10 student records; On the last page there will be 4 student records. The app can handle different amounts of records.
* I also implemented a search bar for this project. Note that you can search for a record with lower case letters, as well as with capital letters - it doesn't matter, and the search will be functional anyway.
* I used two types of event listeners - 'click' and 'keyup'. The 'keyup' event listener works well, so the button is kind of redundant - but I kept it anyway.
* If you'll try to search for a record that does not exist, an informative 'No Results' message will be shown.
* In case you want to quit the search functionality, simply remove the input you have entered.
* In order to run the application download the project files and open 'index.html' or one of the top two files in the 'examples' folder ('44students.html', '64students.html').
